<p>In the show Avatar: The Last Airbender "Uncle" Iroh is the beloved uncle of
   Prince Zuko. He is a very kind and loving old man who taught Prince Zuko (and
   many others) how to be a better person. Iroh taught us all so many valuable
   lessons and gave us so many unforgettable memories. Below are just a few
   moments that made us all love Uncle just a <em>little</em> bit more!</p>
