# hello-world
I'm still learning the basics of coding and just wanted to do this little project as a way to hone my skills and get some practice in and move up from there. This project is meant to be very basic and I plan to make additions/changes as I learn more and can apply more knowledge to it. 
I basically just want a tribute page that talks a little bit about Uncle Iroh from Avatar the Last Airbender. I plan to put down some examples of things that fans loved about Iroh including funny/witty moments or times where Iroh taught us a lesson through Zuko.
